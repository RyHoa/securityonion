# Elasticsearch
==========

From https://www.elastic.co/elasticsearch/:

    
    Elasticsearch is a distributed, RESTful search and analytics
    engine capable of addressing a growing number of use cases.
    As the heart of the Elastic Stack, it centrally stores your
    data for lightning fast search, fineâ€‘tuned relevancy, and
    powerful analytics that scale with ease.

An API key is necessary for utilizing Elasticsearch.

## Installation
------------

In order to begin, we will need to make sure we satisfy a few prerequisites:

| **Elasticsearch API key** - can be obtained at:
  https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/security-api-create-api-key.html

| **Elasticsearch VM** - follow the instructions here:
  https://github.com/peasead/elastic-container

| **An active connection to an Elasticsearch VM** - to make queries

## Configuration Requirements
``authUser``          - Username used for communication with elasticsearch database
``authPWD``           - password used for communication with elasticsearch
``base_url``          - URL that connect to Elasticsearch VM on port 9200. Example format :"https://<your IP address>:9200
``index``             -the index of the data in Elasticsearch database. Default value is _all
``numResults``        -the max number of results will be displayed
``timeDeltaMinutes``  -Range of time the users want the data. The value is in minutes and will be converted to days. Defaults value is is 1440
``timestampFieldName``-the name of your timestamp field name. Default value is @timestamp
``map``               -this is the dictionary of the field name in the user's Elasticsearch database. Example value {"hash":"userhashfieldname"}. This value will map the Security Onion hash field name to user hash field name.

This value should be set in the ``sensoroni`` pillar, like so:

```
sensoroni:
  analyzers:
    elasticsearch:
      api_key: $yourapikey
      numResults:$yournumResults
      index:$yourindex
      timeDeltaMinutes:$yourtimeDeltaMinutes
      timestampFieldName:$yourtimestampFieldName
```
## Description
------------
Elasticsearch supports queries towards user's database:
User can use these observable type to query :hash, domain, file, filename, fqdn, gimphash, ip, mail, mail_subject, regexp, registry, telfhash, tlsh, uri_path, url, and user-agent values

Elasticsearch returns an informational breakdown of the queried observable.
